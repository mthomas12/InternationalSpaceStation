# InternationalSpaceStation
This app uses JS and a fetch API to retrieve ISS data 
refresh browser for updated ISS info
please do not try to use this on internet explorer 

I used a fetch command to get data from the wheretheiss.at API
I found the fields that I wanted, parced the external data and displayed them to the webpage by manipulaing the DOM
I created an Update button to hit to show the most updated coordinates for the ISS

Load project and must hit the UPDATE button for data to display in real time
